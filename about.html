            In <b>2002</b>, a baby in the name of Dung was born in a hospital,
            far from his hometown, in the city called Hanoi, which is the
            capital of Vietnam. His mother was a teacher in Thaibinh province
            and his dad was a salesman. Dung was later renamed to Hoang, because
            coincidentally enough, one of his great uncle happened to be named
            "Dung" as well, which was a no no at the time. Hoang was a healthy
            boy with a natural talent of using his left hand. His family later
            moved to Hanoi, a city of opportunities.

            As the year of <b>2013</b> rolled around, he who was mourning in the
            lost of his grandfather, who he dearly loved, began his journey into
            the wilderness of middle school. Hoang, who was short and skinny,
            got along very well with his classmates and became one of the most
            liked people in class. BUT!, his joy quickly came to a halt when his
            Math teacher turned out to be his own mother. His nightmares began.

            them. Hoang has grown up to become a fairly strong, not so tall, not
            so handsome of a man, and many experience with love. Throughout
            those years, thanks to his mother's teaching and occasional nagging,
            maths became one of his strong suits, helping him ace his
            pre-highschool exams, one of the most important exams in Vietnam.
            Hoang began flipping to a new chapters, studying at one of the most
            prestigious high school in the city.

            excited, yet scared of what is ahead of him. Nevertheless, Hoang
            headed into the new page with his head up high and never looked
            back.

            used to the life of a Canadian citizen, and was having the best time
            of his life. Covid happened.............. And you know the rest.
            Many sleepless nights sitting on computer, wasting away, waiting for
            this pandemic to finally end. His life was flipped upside down.

            an old buddy from work, and shaked things up in a positive way. He
            and Hoang are best friends till this day.
